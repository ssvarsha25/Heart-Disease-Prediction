# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. The model is built using the Random Forest algorithm and has an accuracy of 90%. The project also includes an interactive Streamlit interface for easy use by healthcare professionals.

# Project Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Tool provides predictions on the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease. It leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors and uses a Random Forest model to make predictions. The results are presented through an intuitive Streamlit interface to aid medical decision-making.

# Files Included
Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model is included. It contains health-related attributes like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

Code: Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.\n

Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows users to input patient data and view the heart disease prediction.\n

Model: The trained Random Forest model is saved and used for predictions.
# Features
Random Forest Model: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease with 93% accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifies significant health parameters affecting heart conditions.
Streamlit Interface: Provides a simple web
# Usage
The user can input patient details such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., through the Streamlit interface. The model will predict the risk of heart disease and provide insights into key health factors.

# Requirements
Python Streamlit Pandas Scikit-learn Matplotlib Numpy
